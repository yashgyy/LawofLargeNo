# LawofLargeNo

This project is an attempt to illustrate the Law of Large No in stastical Analysis and is defined as Follows

* The theorm states that for large no of observations the probability of ocuurence of one event equals the theoritical probability

* In other words the theorm tells us that in the longer run practically the probability of happening of each of the equally likely events becomes almost the same

_The Reproducible Pitch for the project can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/ysk96/cointoss)_

_The Simulation implemented in Shiny can be found [here](https://projectclickstream.shinyapps.io/Simulation/)_
